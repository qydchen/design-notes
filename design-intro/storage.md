## Storage

Disk - Refers to HDD or SSD. Data written to disk will persist through power failures and general machine crashes. Disk is also referred to as non-volatile storage. SSD is faster than HDD in terms of accessing data, but also far more expensive financially. HDD will typically be used for data that's rarely accessed or updated, but that's stored for a long time, and SSD will be used for data that's frequently accessed and updated

Memory - Short for RAM. Data stored in memory will be lost when the process taht has written that data dies

Persistence - Usually refers to disk, but in general it is any form of storage that persists if the process in charge of managing it dies
